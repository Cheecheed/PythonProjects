This is the start of my project!
Currently, it only has tictactoe logic, and blackjack no proper user display, login, database, other games, or basically anything of real value.
If you download the repository, the fun can begin(assuming you have python installed correctly) by running python Main_config.py





If you run it you can have a great game of tictactoe locally with a friend!
Pretty simple design, the code has loads of comments describing what's happening, and will allow you to play tictactoe worry free with your friends, provided they
dont mind crowding around a single PC to play tictactoe!
If you want to play simple blackjack against a dealer, starting with $500 to see how far you can go,
that is also a possibility! compete with your friends by downloading multiple instances on multiple pcs! (Obviously a joke dont do that, much better Blackjack around this is a personal project)

Plans for the future!:
Include a user database that keeps track of win loss records, as well as unique login information for each user! (no emails required, not that serious bro)
Include a multitude of simple, competitive based games, a global player balance ( as you can always count on gambling from an American), leaderboards for
balance, wins, and yes. Losses. Love to see some good losers ya kno.
Card games, guessing games, coin flips, tictactoe, maybe even some tile/grid based puzzle types!


About me:
Around 3 weeks of coding experience as of 5/14/24, so this will mark the progress I can make!
If you are reading this, I feel sorry for how little joy you find from life,
but find joy from the fact my work has reached you. Thank you, for having existed,
without you, this would just be another hidden readme, in another github repository, left to crumble and wither in obscurity.
So what I baited you into looking at it, you did, so atleast enjoy whatever games are currently available!
